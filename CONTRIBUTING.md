## Contributing

[The Carpentries][cp-site] ([Software Carpentry][swc-site], [Data
Carpentry][dc-site], and [Library Carpentry][lc-site]) are open source
projects, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to
existing material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all
welcome.

### Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our
license](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess
your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our
community. Everyone involved in [The Carpentries][cp-site] agrees to abide by
our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling
mistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to
introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by
   email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use
   one of the other methods described below.

2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create
   one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems
   or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][repo-issues]. This allows us
   to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,
   you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are
   [included below](#using-github). For inspiration about changes that need to
   be made, check out the [list of open issues][issues] across the Carpentries.

Note: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The Workbench
documentation][template-doc].

### Where to Contribute

1. If you wish to change this lesson (ie the demo), add issues and pull requests here.
2. To contribute to this possible workbench feature, file issues or make PRs against and/or katrinabrock/sandpaper@flavors or katrinabrock/varnish@flavors.

This is feature is not endorsed or requested by Carpentries. It's something I've worked on on my own so contributing to my branches does not guarentee that your code will be encorperated to the main Carpentries codebase.

### What to Contribute

See the TODO list in the README for things that need doing.

If you notice a bug/gap that is not already listed there, feel free to file and issue.

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are
smarter together than we are on our own. **Reviews from novices and newcomers
are particularly valuable**: it's easy for people who have been using these
lessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so
fresh eyes are always welcome.

### What *Not* to Contribute

It probably isn't terribly worthwhile to finetune the contents of the lesson itself since in only serves as a demo of workbench features. I am willing to accept such contributions, but they probably aren't worth your time.

### Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to
Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we
use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each
   significant change.
2. Commit the change in that branch.
3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].
5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your
   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

NB: The published copy of the lesson is usually in the `main` branch.
